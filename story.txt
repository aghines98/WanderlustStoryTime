On a hot Monday morning, Tommy went to the baeckerei without klimaanlage. 
He ordered a warm Br√∂tchen and hoped a glass of Wasser would cool him down.
Tommy's overall temperature was exacerbated by the fact he wore his favorite
leaderhose instead of something lighter. What was he supposed to do, it's 
Oktober, afterall, and he can't be seen walking down Hauptstrasse, and perceived 
as not being festive. On Hauptstrasse a frisky Hund stole his Doener, 
so Tommy dashed to the Flughafen, swore he would trade the BMW for a Porsche with working Klimaanlage, 
and promised the crowd free Gebaeck at the Baeckerei if they would point him toward Raesfeld. Alas,
no one wanted his BMW without working klimaanlage. The crowd booed Tommy's BMW and 
threw their apfelkuchen at him. Tommy decided to leave the Flughafen before the crowd began 
throwing their bratwurst. He hopped in his BMW and went to the Biergarten where Rammstein 
was playing and bier and bratwurst were flowing. He had a truly German Oktoberfest!
