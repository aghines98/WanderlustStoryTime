On a hot Monday morning, Tommy went to the baeckerei without klimaanlage. 
He ordered a warm Br√∂tchen and hoped a glass of Wasser would cool him down.
Tommy's overall temperature was exacerbated by the fact he wore his favorite
leaderhose instead of something lighter. What was he supposed to do, it's 
Oktober, afterall, and he can't be seen walking down Hauptstrasse, and perceived 
as not being festive.
