On a hot Monday morning, Tommy went to the baeckerei without klimaanlage. 
He ordered a warm Br√∂tchen and hoped a glass of Wasser would cool him down.
Tommy's overall temperature was exacerbated by the fact he wore his favorite
leaderhose instead of something lighter. What was he supposed to do, it's 
Oktober, afterall, and he can't be seen walking down Hauptstrasse, and perceived 
as not being festive. He hopped in his BMW and went to the Biergarten where Rammstein 
was playing and bier and bratwurst were flowing. He had a truly German Oktoberfest!

On Hauptstrasse a frisky Hund stole his Doener, so Tommy dashed to the Flughafen, swore 
he would trade the BMW for a Porsche with working Klimaanlage, and promised the crowd free 
Gebaeck at the Baeckerei if they would point him toward Raesfeld. A rich gentleman 
agreed to trade his porsche for Tommy's BMW and invited Tommy to his schloss in Raesfeld. 
The two of them drove to Raesfeld, bratwurst in hand, accompanied by a beautiful sunset.
Tommy wanted a sweet treat after his bratwurst, so the two men stopped at a dessert stand
and purchased some apfelkuchen.
